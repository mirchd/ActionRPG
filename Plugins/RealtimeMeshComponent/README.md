The RuntimeMeshComponent or more commonly known as RMC, is a replacement to the ProceduralMeshComponent (aka PMC) found in UE4. The RMC is much more efficient, and carries many more features, while allowing for a much more fine-grained approach for advanced use cases, while being simple to use just like the PMC. It can handle any use case from simply loading models at runtime, to debug views, to modification of existing models all the way up to procedural generation of entire worlds!

The RMC has been around for 6+ years and has an active community of users from individuals, to schools, to Fortune 500 companies, with many released projects. You can also find active support in our Discord server here: https://discord.gg/KGvBBTv

This project is a labor of love. If you'd like to support the efforts, you may donate to me here: https://www.paypal.me/Koderz
This is not a sale of the plugin, that will be available on the marketplace soon, this is simply another way to support the project if you are so generous.
